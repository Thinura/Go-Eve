# Go-Eve
Go-Eve provide a solution for the socializing issue which is prevailing in the current generation, which is getting addicted to the mobile phone rather than real socializing. For this we are hoping to develop a mobile app which caters to all the people interested in socializing to make them use it to get to know more people by actually attending events and meeting them in person. We are also hoping to solve the ticketing and attendance issue by bringing all the communication to our one-stop event and socializing app.  Initially we will be targeting professional events so that people with similar interests can get together and socialize. We are also hoping to solve the sponsorship issue which many organizers face to get funds for the events that they are organizing.
